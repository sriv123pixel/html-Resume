        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student with a genuine interest in building things through code. I’ve developed a strong grasp of C and Java, and I’m currently diving into the world of web development—learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into working software. I'm always curious and open to challenges that help me grow as a developer, and I’m looking forward to gaining real-world experience where I can apply and sharpen my skills.
